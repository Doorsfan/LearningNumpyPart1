       -------------------------
==========================================================================
   DIFFICULTIES: 
   
   There were some parts of this specific tutorial and overview that i missed out on.
   Whilst the actual mathematics and what not were not of very hard difficulty,
   there were some parts that were lost unto me.
   
   Most notably was the higher level of Mathematics, that were kind of hard for me to figure out.
   All i had to go on, was documentation outside of the actual function backgrounds and documentation.
   
==========================================================================
  
   WHAT I LEARNED:
   
   I felt like i learned a lot of Matris dynamics, a bit of implicit conversion, broadcasting
   Some mathematical operations, some pattern recognition

   There also were some instances of where functional subsectioning and lambda partitionings 
   in the documentation were to be of something relevant to talk about - But, that's more on the level
   of that i recall it bypassingly.
   
==========================================================================

   WHAT WENT WRONG:
   
   I think partially, failure to fully realize some of the higher levels of dynamics along with lack of integration
   of speed optimization, caused a failure of accounting of deeper dynamics.
  
   past this, i think application of real modelling in terms of a real project, needs to be done.
   And partially, some better balance must be applied in the amount of time done/taken.

==========================================================================

   WHAT'S NEXT:
   
   Next up, i want to look into of how to perform better structures of SQL queries

==========================================================================
    
    Time taken: 2-3 Weeks approximately
